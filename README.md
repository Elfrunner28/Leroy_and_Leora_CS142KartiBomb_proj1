Leroy the Lynx begins with 24 cookies, labeled with the numbers 2 through 25, inclusive. Like in the previous game, he wants to eat as 
many cookies as possible, but now he is playing against the other Rhodes mascot, Leora the Lynx. Each time one of the lynxes eats a cookie,
they get the number of points that the cookie is worth (so unlike the first game, where all the cookies were “equal,” in this game, 
higher-valued cookies are worth more points). The game begins with all 24 cookies available, except for 4, which are chosen randomly and
removed, to make the game different each time it is played. Leroy can then choose any cookie to eat (and he then earns that many points).
However, Leora then gets to eat all the cookies that have numbers that are factors of Leroy’s cookie. For instance, if Leroy eats cookie
10, he gets 10 points, but then Leora gets to eat cookies 2 and 5, and gets 7 points. Leroy is not allowed to eat any cookie that would 
result in Leora getting zero points (in other words, Leroy can never eat a cookie that has no factors left on the board). Leroy also cannot 
eat any cookie that has already been eaten. Leroy then gets to pick another cookie to eat. This continues as long as Leroy wants (notice 
that Leora never gets to pick cookies directly, her cookies are determined from what Leroy picks). After Leroy decides to stop eating 
cookies (or cannot eat any more due to the rule about factors), the game ends. At this point, Leora gets to eat all the remaining cookies 
on the board! The winner is whoever has more points at the end.
